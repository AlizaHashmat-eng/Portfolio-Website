        <h1>Final Year Project: Grad.io – University Recommendation System</h1>

        <section class="project-description">
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Grad.io is an innovative university recommendation system designed to align students’ academic paths with
                their unique personalities, interests, and career aspirations. The system assesses user personalities
                through the RIASEC personality test & user’s text-based input for their interests. Utilizing a
                comprehensive dataset gathered from various university websites via web scraping, Grad.io provides
                tailored recommendations for academic programs according to their academic grades.</p>

            <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Team Leadership:</strong> Led a team of 4 in developing Grad.io, a platform that assists
                    students in selecting universities and degree programs based on their grades, preferences, and
                    interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> Designed and developed Backend APIs, incorporating RESTful
                    architecture, to process & handle the scrapped data of universities, user’s academic grades, RIASEC
                    Personality assessment results & user interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Personality Assessment Implementation:</strong> Implemented the RIASEC model for personality
                    assessment, using Cosine similarity & Sentence Transformer to match students’ interests and
                    personalities with suitable university programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Utilized NLP libraries along with Porter Stemmer and
                    word lemmatization for preprocessing user interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implemented authentication and tokenization to ensure secure access to
                    the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Optimization:</strong> Optimized the model to increase the accuracy of university
                    program recommendations by 30%.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Implemented web scraping using Selenium to gather data from around
                    200 leading universities in Pakistan. Ensured the data was up-to-date and accurate for reliable
                    recommendations.</li>
